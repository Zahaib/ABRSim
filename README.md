# ABRSim
## Introduction
ABRSim is a Discrete Event Simulator ([DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation)) of an online video player. It takes as input a throughput trace, a configuration of player such as maximum buffer length and the ABR algorithm. It currently allows to choose from three ABR algorithm: a pure throughput based ABR, a buffer based ABR and a hybrid ABR that uses both buffer and througput information to make bitrate decision.

Will add usage instruction and notes later.
